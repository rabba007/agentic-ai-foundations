      "1. Moonbase: A conceptual lunar base that was initially proposed by NASA in the 1960s. Although there have been numerous studies, experiments, and missions to the Moon, a permanent, self-sustaining base has not been established.\n",

      "2. Lunar Gateway: A planned lunar-orbiting space station developed by the international space agencies of the United States, Europe, Japan, Canada, and others. The Gateway is intended to serve as a base for exploration, but it is not a city or a permanent settlement.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. SpaceX's Starship: Elon Musk's company, SpaceX, has developed a reusable spacecraft called Starship for transporting humans and cargo to the Moon and other destinations in space. While there have been discussions about using Starship as a potential lunar base, it's not a city in the classical sense.\n",

      "4. Blue Moon: Virgin Galactic's lunar tourism venture is called Blue Moon, which aims to provide commercial flights to the Moon's surface. However, it does not intend to establish a permanent city or settlement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding potential future plans, some proposals for lunar development include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- NASA's plans for a sustainable, long-term human presence on the Moon by the 2020s, with a focus on establishing a lunar base for scientific research and exploration.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The Artemis program: A NASA initiative aimed at sending the first woman and the next man to the Moon by 2024 and establishing a sustainable human presence on the lunar surface by the 2020s.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Concepts for in-situ resource utilization (ISRU): Some proposals involve using lunar resources, such as water ice, to create fuel, oxygen, and other necessary materials for sustaining human life on the Moon.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's essential to note that the establishment of a human settlement or city on the Moon is a complex task that requires significant technological advancements, logistical planning, and financial investment.
